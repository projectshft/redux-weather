## Weather Project

Search for a city to view three different graphs representing the average temperature, pressure and humidity for that location. The graphs will show data based on todays forecast as well as the next four days giving you a five day average. 

This project has been created by a student at Parsity, an online software engineering course. The work in this repository is wholly of the student based on a sample starter project that can be accessed by looking at the repository that this project forks.
