# Redux Weather App

Search a city name and get back three graphs displaying the temperature, pressure, humidity, and corresponding averages for that city over the next 5 days. This app was built with React using Vite, Redux, and utilizes the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/).

## Run Locally

To run locally, fork and clone this repository. `cd` into the directory you created and execute the following commands:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Now you can type a city name into the input box and retrieve weather data about it. If you get an error, check your spelling. If the city you want isn't coming up, enter the city, state, and two-letter country ISO code (for example, "Chicago, Illinois, US").
