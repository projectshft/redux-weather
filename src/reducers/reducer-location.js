//Reducers are functions that take the current state and an action as arguments, and return a new state result.
//In other words, (state, action) => newState.
//A Redux app really only has one reducer function: the "root reducer" function that you will pass
//to createStore later on. That one root reducer function is responsible for handling all of the actions
//that are dispatched, and calculating what the entire new state result should be every time.
